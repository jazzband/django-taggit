External Applications
=====================

In addition to the features included in ``django-taggit`` directly, there are a
number of external applications which provide additional features that may be
of interest.

.. note::

    Despite their mention here, the following applications are in no way
    official, nor have they in any way been reviewed or tested.

If you have an application that you'd like to see listed here, simply fork
`django-taggit on github <https://github.com/jazzband/django-taggit>`_,
add it to this list, and send a pull request.

 * `django-taggit-anywhere <https://github.com/bashu/django-taggit-anywhere>`_:
   Simpler approach to tagging with ``taggit``. Additionally this
   project provides easy-to-use integration with ``django-taggit-helpers`` and
   ``django-taggit-labels``.
 * `django-taggit-helpers <https://github.com/mfcovington/django-taggit-helpers>`_:
   Makes it easier to work with admin pages of models
   associated with ``taggit`` tags by adding helper classes: ``TaggitCounter``,
   ``TaggitListFilter``, ``TaggitStackedInline``, ``TaggitTabularInline``.
 * `django-taggit-labels <https://github.com/bennylope/django-taggit-labels>`_:
   Provides a clickable label widget for the
   Django admin for user friendly selection from managed tag sets.
 * `django-taggit-serializer <https://github.com/glemmaPaul/django-taggit-serializer>`_:
   Adds functionality for using ``taggit`` with
   ``django-rest-framework``.
 * `django-taggit-suggest <https://github.com/frankwiles/django-taggit-suggest>`_:
   Provides support for defining keyword and regular
   expression rules for suggesting new tags for content.  This used to be
   available at ``taggit.contrib.suggest``.
 * `django-taggit-templatetags <https://github.com/feuervogel/django-taggit-templatetags>`_:
   Provides several templatetags, including one
   for tag clouds, to expose various ``taggit`` APIs directly to templates.
 * `django-taggit-bulk <https://github.com/nnseva/django-taggit-bulk>`_:
   An admin action for the bulk tagging from the model  admin instance list view.
