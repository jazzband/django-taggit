Welcome to django-taggit's documentation!
=========================================

``django-taggit`` is a reusable Django application designed to making adding
tagging to your project easy and fun.

``django-taggit`` works with Django 1.4.5+ and Python 2.7-3.X.

.. warning::

   Since version 0.10.0 taggit uses South for database migrations.
   This means that users who are upgrading to 0.10.0 and up will have to fake
   the initial migration, like this::

      python manage.py migrate taggit --fake 0001
      python manage.py migrate

   Since version 0.12.0 taggit uses Django migrations by default. South users
   have to adjust their settings::

      SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
          'taggit': 'taggit.south_migrations',
      }

   For more information, see `south documentation`__
