Getting Started
===============

To get started using ``django-taggit`` simply install it with
``pip``::

    $ pip install django-taggit


Add ``"taggit"`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

Run `./manage.py syncdb` or `./manage.py migrate` if using migrations.

.. note::

    If you are using South you'll have to add the following setting, since
    taggit uses Django migrations by default::

      SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
          'taggit': 'taggit.south_migrations',
      }

And then to any model you want tagging on do the following::

    from django.db import models

    from taggit.managers import TaggableManager

    class Food(models.Model):
        # ... fields here

        tags = TaggableManager()
