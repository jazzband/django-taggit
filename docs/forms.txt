Tags in forms
=============

The ``TaggableManager`` will show up automatically as a field in a
``ModelForm`` or in the admin. Tags are easily changed using an interface
powered by `jQuery Tag-It <http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/>`_.

You can change the default placeholder text of the widget by adding
placeholder_text to the manager like so::

    from django.db import models

    from taggit.managers import TaggableManager

    class Food(models.Model):
        tags = TaggableManager(placeholder_text="Add a new food group")


``commit=False``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If, when saving a form, you use the ``commit=False`` option you'll need to call
``save_m2m()`` on the form after you save the object, just as you would for a
form with normal many to many fields on it::

    if request.method == "POST":
        form = MyFormClass(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            obj = form.save(commit=False)
            obj.user = request.user
            obj.save()
            # Without this next line the tags won't be saved.
            form.save_m2m()
