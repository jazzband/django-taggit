Using tags in the admin
=======================

By default if you have a :class:`TaggableManager` on your model it will show up
in the admin, just as it will in any other form.  One important thing to note
is that you *cannot* include a :class:`TaggableManager` in
:attr:`ModelAdmin.list_display`, if you do you'll see an exception that looks
like::

    AttributeError: 'TaggableManager' object has no attribute 'flatchoices'

This is for the same reason that you cannot include a :class:`ManyToManyField`,
it would result in an unreasonable number of queries being executed.  If you really would like to add it, you can read the
`Django documentation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display>`_.
