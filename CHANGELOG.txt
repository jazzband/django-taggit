0.12.0 (20.04.2014)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   for taggit.
 * **Backwards incompatible:** Django's new transaction handling is used on
   Django 1.6 and newer.
 * **Backwards incompatible:** ``Tag.save`` got changed to opportunistically
   try to save the tag and if that fails fall back to selecting existing
   similar tags and retry -- if that fails too an ``IntegrityError`` is
   raised by the database, your app will have to handle that.
 * Added Italian and Esperanto translations.

~~~~~

 * **Backwards incompatible:**  Forms containing a :class:`TaggableManager` by
   default now require tags, to change this provide ``blank=True`` to the
   :class:`TaggableManager`.
 * Now works with Django 1.3 (as of beta-1).

0.9.0
~~~~~

 * Added a Hebrew locale.
 * Added an index on the ``object_id`` field of ``TaggedItem``.
 * When displaying tags always join them with commas, never spaces.
 * The docs are now available `online <http://django-taggit.readthedocs.org/>`_.
 * Custom ``Tag`` models are now allowed.
 * **Backwards incompatible:**  Filtering on tags is no longer
   ``filter(tags__in=["foo"])``, it is written
   ``filter(tags__name__in=["foo"])``.
 * Added a German locale.
 * Added a Dutch locale.
 * Removed ``taggit.contrib.suggest``, it now lives in an external application,
   see :doc:`external_apps` for more information.

0.8.0
~~~~~

 * Fixed querying for objects using ``exclude(tags__in=tags)``.
 * Marked strings as translatable.

   * Added a Russian translation.
 * Created a `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/django-taggit>`_.
 * Smarter tagstring parsing for form field; ported from Jonathan
   Buchanan's `django-tagging
   <http://django-tagging.googlecode.com>`_. Now supports tags
   containing commas. See :ref:`tags-in-forms` for details.
 * Switched to using savepoints around the slug generation for tags.  This
   ensures that it works fine on databases (such as Postgres) which dirty a
   transaction with an ``IntegrityError``.
 * Added Python 2.4 compatibility.
 * Added Django 1.1 compatibility.
